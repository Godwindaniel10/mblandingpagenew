          Musiqbanq is a multipurpose cooperative society committed to improving
          the financial welfare and business development of its members.
          <br />
          We're registered and licensed by the Lagos State Government under the
          Cooperative Societies Act (2013) as amended.
          <br /><br />
          Our aim is to grant access to ZERO interest loans to our members who
          are just starting up their music career or run a small business as a
          side hustle in order to maximise their profits or potentials into
          mental, physical and financial growth. We want to ease the burden of
          our members by giving them access to seamless funding that would
          enable them develop their small businesses or talents to the heights
          and top levels their imagination can take them.
          <br /><br />
          Institutional funding for upcoming artistes and small businesses in
          Nigeria is very cumbersome or almost non existent. In cases where
          funding is eventually obtained it comes at cut throat interest rates
          and unfreindly terms of agreement. We at MUSIQBANQ are approaching
          this segment of underserved individuals like comrades in the struggle
          who feel their pain and want to be a part of their success stories by
          granting these ZERO interest loans like a genuine friend who will do
          all things humanly possible to see a promising friend succeed.
